It's all wrong but I'm alright
It should be goodbye this time
Because every time we talk you just cry

Either way it's all the same
With or without you I'm in pain
Don't see the point in lying

I can make it easy
To make you leave me
Go right ahead
Walk out the door
Because we're both from
Broken families
We'll keep coming back for more

You get high, I get drunk
But you're still who I want
I don't need much to get through

Now we're fighting again
I wasn't flirting with your best friend
I was just trying to impress you

I can make it easy
To make you leave me
Go right ahead walk out the door
Because we're both from
Broken families
We'll keep coming back for more

We're two wrongs (we're two wrongs)
Trying to make it right (trying to make it right)
We belong to one another
No other lovers worth the fight (worth the fight)
I need you (I need you)
I need you tonight
So take me back let's try one more time

I can make it easy
I don't want you to leave me
Turn around, walk back in the door
Because we're both from
Broken families
We don't want that anymore
